# Learning Backend 
Welcome to my backend learning project! This repo is all about getting hands-on with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB while implementing core backend functionalities.

🔧 Features Implemented
📦 Database (MongoDB) & Models

🛠️ Controllers & Routes (for handling API logic)

🔄 Middleware (for authentication, logging, etc.)

🛡️ JWT Authentication (Access & Refresh Tokens)

🌍 CORS Handling (to enable cross-origin requests)

⚡ Utility Functions (helper methods for efficiency)
